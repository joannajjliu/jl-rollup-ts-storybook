- run tests: `yarn run test:watch`

### Creating Components

- Create component folders under the src folder. (ex. TestComponent, Button, Form folders)
- Inside each component folder - we'll use TestComponent for our example here:
  - Create the component: TestComponent.tsx
    - Export our component to **srx/index.ts**
  - Declare types for the component props (import into TestComponent.tsx once complete): TestComponent.types.ts
  - Create stories for the component (these will show up when you run `yarn run storybook`): TestComponent.stories.tsx
    - Import our component from **src/index.ts** file (to apply bootstrap and any global styles)
  - Create styles for the component (import these into TestComponent.tsx once complete): TestComponent.scss
  - Create tests for the component (test these using `yarn run test:watch`): TestComponent.test.tsx
- If you haven't done so already, make sure to export your component to **src/index.ts**
  - this is how other applications will be able to use our components
